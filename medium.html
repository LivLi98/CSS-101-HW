        <p style="border-width: 4px; border-style: solid; border-color: blue;">Hello, nice to meet you! My name is Olivia Anderson. I am 25 years old and  a current employee at Home Depot. I have a lot of dreams and aspirations
             but the main things is to have my very own production company and have my movies in theaters all around the world. 
            I am also a photographer, videographer, and I even have my own documentary out on youtube. 
            I am also in a coding bootcamp which is one of the services I want to offer in my production comany.
            This bootcamp is more than just learning about codes to me. I want this class to be a personal growth experience so I can become a better over all person.
            Overall, I'm very excited the new chapter in my life.
